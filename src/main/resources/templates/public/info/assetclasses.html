                        Strategic Asset Allocation: <br />
                        How is one's wealth distributed among asset classes (Fixed Income, Equity, Real Estate, Commodity), and sub-classes is the key factor. In the investment industry, this distribution is widely known as "Asset Allocation". (e.g. 40% in Real Estate, 30% in Diversified Equity, 5% in individual Mid-cap stocks, 20% in fixed income, 3% in commodity, 2% in Cash). This asset allocation helps us to understand risk-returns characteristics and to predict the probable outcome of the investment. Is that high risk suitable for the investor? Is portfolio's risk considerably higher than the investor can afford to take? Or is investor too conservative? Does one have enough liquidity when a large amount of money is required within a short period? Answers to these questions can be easily answered by just looking at asset allocation.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Strategic asset allocation involves meeting the investorâ€™s long-term and short-term financial goals. Strategic asset allocation decision is the most important decision relative to any other investment decision (whether the investor should buy or sell a particular financial product or a security). This asset allocation decision involves budgeting resources effectively for meeting the investor's financial goals.
                        <br /> <br />
                        This strategic asset allocation changes with 1) Regular net income (i.e. income after expenses) 2) Performance or appreciation of invested assets. Strategic asset allocation decision requires considering stages in the lifecycle, any unanticipated event. Also valuation of asset classes, the economic outcome changes with time. These all require strategic asset allocation to be monitored periodically and rebalance your portfolio or wealth distribution periodically.
                        <br /> <br />
                        We, for simplicity, consider here 6 basic asset classes. Each asset class has different characteristics. Bank FDs and Debt Mutual Funds are having more or less same characteristics at a broader level. They are usually used to protect capital and their returns are less volatile. Equity Mutual Funds, investment in individual stocks, on the other hand, are riskier than Bank FDs and Debt Mutual Funds.
